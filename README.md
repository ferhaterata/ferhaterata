Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
- 🎓 I'm currently a PhD candidate at Yale University.
- 🔭 My recent research focuses on learning of randomized reductions and program properties ([Bitween](https://bitween.fun)), with applications in
  - safeguarding LLM outputs,
  - hardware security,
  - private computation, and
  - quantum circuits.
- ⚡ I use ML/AI and Automated Reasoning techniques in my research.
- 📕 I’m currently learning machine learning (ml) and large language models (llms).
- 💬 Ask me about program analysis and automated reasoning in general.
